## Configuration

InfiniAIBook talks to any **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint, or to Azure OpenAI.

### Named providers

The quickest route is a preset: set `AI_PROVIDER` and that provider's usual key
variable, and the base URL and default models are filled in.

```ini
AI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# AI_MODEL=gpt-4o                       # optional: override the preset's model
```

| `AI_PROVIDER` | Key variable | Default chat model | Embeddings | Transcription |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | gpt-4o-mini | text-embedding-3-small | whisper-1 |
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | claude-sonnet-4-5 | — | — |
| `gemini` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | gemini-2.5-flash | gemini-embedding-001 | — |
| `groq` | `GROQ_API_KEY` | llama-3.3-70b-versatile | — | whisper-large-v3 |
| `mistral` | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | mistral-small-latest | mistral-embed | — |
| `deepseek` | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | deepseek-chat | — | — |
| `openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | openai/gpt-4o-mini | — | — |
| `xai` | `XAI_API_KEY` | grok-3-mini | — | — |
| `perplexity` | `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` | sonar | — | — |
| `together` | `TOGETHER_API_KEY` | Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo | bge-large-en-v1.5 | — |
| `ollama` | none (local) | qwen3.5:latest | nomic-embed-text | — |
| `lmstudio` / `llamacpp` | none (local) | set `AI_MODEL` | set `AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | — |
| `azure` | Entra ID or `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | see below | | |

**Mixing providers.** Embeddings (for semantic retrieval) and transcription
(for audio/video sources) can go to a different provider from chat, which is
what a chat-only provider such as Anthropic needs:

```ini
AI_PROVIDER=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
AI_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai          # or AI_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL / _API_KEY / _MODEL
AI_TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=groq        # or AI_TRANSCRIPTION_BASE_URL / _API_KEY / _MODEL
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GROQ_API_KEY=...
```

Without an embedding endpoint the app still works; retrieval falls back to
keyword ranking and says so.

### Custom endpoints

**Local or third-party** — set a base URL and it takes precedence over Azure:

```ini
AI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1   # llama.cpp llama-server
AI_MODEL=qwen3.5:latest
AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
# AI_API_KEY=                          # only if the endpoint needs one
```

Works with llama.cpp's `llama-server`, Ollama (`:11434/v1`), LM Studio
(`:1234/v1`), vLLM, or OpenAI itself. Chat and embeddings are separate models:
llama.cpp needs `--embeddings`, Ollama needs a dedicated embedding model
(`ollama pull nomic-embed-text`).

> **Expect it to be slow without a GPU.** Measured on a CPU-only VM via Ollama:
> ingesting one short source took 8m34s, and a one-line chat answer 2m52s. The
> same work on Azure takes seconds. On a GPU or Apple Silicon this is far
> quicker, but "no API key needed" is not the same as "fast".

**Azure OpenAI** — used when neither `AI_PROVIDER` nor `AI_BASE_URL` is set
(or with `AI_PROVIDER=azure`):
```ini
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR-RESOURCE.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-10-21
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-5                             # chat deployment name
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT=text-embedding-3-large  # embedding deployment name
AZURE_OPENAI_IMAGE_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-image-2.5-sunburst      # optional, for image infographics
# DATA_DIR=./.data                                        # optional
```

These deployment values are **deployment names** from Azure AI Foundry, not model names.
List what your resource actually has:

```bash
az cognitiveservices account deployment list -n <resource> -g <rg> -o table
```

## Environment variables

Set these in `.env.local`; [`.env.example`](../.env.example) has every one with
commentary. Only a model provider is required.

| Variable | Purpose |

## Checking a provider

Model servers differ in what they actually support, and the gaps only show up
in use. `check:ai` exercises the real code paths against whatever is configured:

```bash
npm run check:ai              # connectivity, chat, streaming, JSON, embeddings
npm run check:ai -- --studio  # also generate all 9 text Studio formats
npm run check:ai -- --styles  # also generate an infographic in every style
npm run check:ai -- --image   # also render a test image
```

It imports the application's own modules, so it cannot drift from what the app
does, and it compares the live embedding size against what is already stored —
catching a model change that would otherwise degrade retrieval silently.

Reference run against Azure `gpt-5-mini`:

```
core
  PASS  chat           3.7s      PASS  embeddings  0.5s — 3072 dims
  PASS  streaming      1.4s      PASS  stored      517 chunks, all 3072 dims
  PASS  json mode      2.1s
studio formats
  PASS  Report        12.3s      PASS  Quiz        21.9s
  PASS  Briefing doc  10.6s      PASS  Study guide 19.2s
  PASS  Infographic   11.9s      PASS  FAQ          7.6s
  PASS  Mind map      15.0s      PASS  Timeline    14.2s
```

## Moving to local inference

1. Start a server with **both** chat and embedding models available —
   `llama-server --port 8080 -m model.gguf --embeddings`, or
   `ollama serve` plus `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`.
2. Point `AI_BASE_URL`, `AI_MODEL` and `AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` at it.
3. Run `npm run check:ai -- --studio`. Structured output is where smaller models
   struggle, and this reports exactly which formats come back malformed rather
   than leaving you to discover it one artifact at a time.
4. Notebooks embedded by the previous model will rank by keyword only until
   repaired; the check warns when it sees this. Fix per notebook with
   `POST /api/notebooks/<id>/reembed`.

> `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` is a dated **API** release such as `2024-10-21`.
> It is not a model version — setting it to something like gpt-5's `2025-08-07`
> makes every call return a confusing 404. The app detects this and says so.

## Reasoning models (gpt-5, o-series)

These deployments reject a custom `temperature` and accept only the default.
Because a deployment name is user-chosen, the model family can't be inferred from
it, so the client probes once, caches the result for the process, and transparently
retries without `temperature`. No configuration needed — gpt-4o and gpt-5 both work.

## Authentication (Microsoft Entra ID)

There is no API key. The app authenticates with `DefaultAzureCredential` and
requests tokens for `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default`.

**Locally** — sign in once, then start the app:

```bash
az login
npm run dev
```

Your account needs the **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role on the Azure
OpenAI resource:

```bash
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)" \
  --role "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<resource>"
```

**On Azure** (App Service, Container Apps, AKS, VM) — enable a managed identity
and grant it the same role. Nothing else to configure. For a *user-assigned*
identity, set `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` to its client id.

**CI / off-Azure containers** — supply a service principal via
`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Token acquisition, caching and refresh are handled per request, so long-running
servers never serve an expired token. Auth failures are translated into
actionable messages in the UI (missing credential vs. missing role assignment)
rather than a bare 401.

> A legacy `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` is still honoured if present, and takes
> precedence over Entra. Leave it unset to use Entra.

Without any working credential the app still runs: sources ingest and are
searchable by keyword, but chat and studio generation return a clear error.

## Rate limits and deployment quota

A deployment's tokens-per-minute quota caps how much context one request may
carry, and studio generation is context-hungry. Two mechanisms keep it working
on small deployments:

1. **Retry with backoff** — 429 and 5xx responses are retried up to five times,
   honouring `Retry-After` when Azure supplies it.
2. **Adaptive context** — if rate limiting persists, generation halves its
   excerpt budget and retries, down to a floor, rather than failing.

`STUDIO_CONTEXT_CHARS` (default `30000`, roughly 7.5K prompt tokens) sets the
starting budget. Raise it on a large deployment for richer artifacts; lower it
if you see repeated throttling. Check what your deployment allows with:

```bash
az cognitiveservices account deployment list -n <resource> -g <rg> \
  --query "[].{name:name, capacity:sku.capacity}" -o table
```
