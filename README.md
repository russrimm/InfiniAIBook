A self-hosted Agentic Powered Notebook research studio. Upload your own sources, chat with
them, talk them through out loud, and turn them into **reports, briefings,
PowerPoint decks, infographics, mind maps, quizzes, flashcards, study guides,
FAQs, timelines, audio overviews, whiteboard videos, motion explainers and
avatar training videos**. Every claim is cited back to the document it came from.

Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript and SQLite. Runs against Azure OpenAI, a dozen
named providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenRouter,
xAI, Perplexity, Together) or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including local
models via Ollama, llama.cpp or LM Studio.

Inspired by [open-notebook](https://github.com/lfnovo/open-notebook).

> **Single-user.** Without `INFINIAIBOOK_PASSWORD`, anyone who can reach the
> server can use it, and your model quota with it. It listens on localhost only
> by default; set a password before using `npm run dev:lan`, or put it behind an
> authenticating proxy — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Sample: an avatar training video

The 🧑‍🏫 **Training video** generator turns a notebook's sources and notes into an
editable trainer's script, then renders it with an Azure AI Foundry
text-to-speech avatar: a lip-synced presenter, signed in with Microsoft Entra ID.
By default the presenter is composed with slides, key numbers, quotes,
knowledge checks, pictures, screenshots and the notebook's infographics. Each
visual slides in when the presenter says the words it illustrates, and you can
plan, edit and preview them in the browser before anything is billed. This 3:37
presenter-only sample came from a notebook of two public "What's new in Copilot
Studio" pages. It rendered in about four and a half minutes.

### Sample: a whiteboard video

The 🎬 **Whiteboard video** generator plans a short scene-by-scene story from
your sources, then draws it: a hand sketches each hand-lettered title and
doodle on a whiteboard while a narrator explains it, with a caption under every
scene. You review and edit the script before anything is drawn or voiced. This
1:14 sample has six scenes and came from the fictional community-garden
notebook used in the [Studio examples](#studio-examples). It rendered in about
six minutes.

How it works and setup: [Whiteboard videos](docs/whiteboard-videos.md).

### Sample: a motion explainer

The 🎞️ **Motion explainer** generator tells a story in 2D animation:
illustrated backgrounds, a recurring character, kinetic headlines, callout chips
and stat cards, following problem, solution, how it works, benefits and a next
step. Length, tone, audience, illustration style, colors, the character and the
closing call to action can all be changed. This 1:50 sample has seven scenes,
uses the default settings and came from the same notebook. It rendered in about
nine minutes.

## Features

- **Sources** — PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, MD, CSV, JSON, HTML, images, audio/video, ZIP archives,
  pasted text, URLs, YouTube links and RSS/Atom feeds; discover sources from a topic,
  browse the web in-app, or reuse a source from another notebook. Uploads are
  processed in the background, and linked sources are re-checked for changes.
  [More](docs/sources.md)
- **Grounded chat** — streaming answers built only from your selected sources,
  with clickable inline citations that open the highlighted passage, **Stop**
  that keeps the partial answer, and multiple chat sessions per notebook.
- **Notes and transformations** — Markdown notes, saved chat answers (citations
  kept), notes turned into sources, and reusable prompts run on a source.
  [More](docs/notes-and-search.md)
- **Live discussions** — talk through your sources out loud: discuss, debate,
  Q&A, interview an expert, get interviewed, an oral quiz or a Socratic tutor.
  The AI answers in real time, lets you interrupt, looks things up in your
  sources mid-conversation and shows clickable citations. Save the call as a
  note with takeaways. [More](docs/discussions.md)
- **Search everything** — keyword or semantic search, and a grounded **Ask**,
  across every notebook. [More](docs/notes-and-search.md#search-and-ask)
- **Screen helper** — share any app's window, type what you need help with,
  and get coached one step at a time, with the next control highlighted on a
  screenshot. Auto-watch notices when you have done a step and suggests the
  next. [More](docs/screen-helper.md)
- **Studio** — fourteen generators, each producing a structured, interactive
  artifact ([see an example of each](#studio-examples)):

  | Format | Output |
  |---|---|
  | 🎧 [Audio overview](docs/audio-overviews.md) | One to four speakers discuss your sources, with a synced transcript |

  the workspace header; a saved choice overrides the environment until reset.
  [More](docs/configuration.md#models-and-what-theyre-used-for)
- **Undo deletes** — deleted sources, notes, chats, artifacts and notebooks can
  be restored for 8 seconds.
- **Reduced motion** — honors the OS or browser `prefers-reduced-motion`
  setting: entrances fade instead of moving, spinners and mind maps stop
  animating, and scrolling jumps instead of gliding.
- **Everything is local** — sources, embeddings, chat history, artifacts and
  media live under `.data/`. Password protection and a Docker image included.

See the [full feature list](docs/features.md) for details.

## Studio examples

Every example below, except the training video, was generated from the same
fictional notebook: four sources about a community-garden pilot (a project
brief, a planting and water plan, volunteer workshop notes and a resident
survey). The numbered badges are citations; hover or click one to see the
passage it came from.

### Audio & video

Audio overviews, whiteboard videos and motion explainers stop at an
**editable script** before anything is narrated or rendered, which is the stage
shown here. Narrating and rendering need Azure Speech, and whiteboard and motion
videos also need an image model and Python; see
[Models and what they're used for](#models-and-what-theyre-used-for).

## Quick start

Requires **Node.js 22.13+** and a model provider.

> **New to this?** Follow [Install step by step](docs/install-guide.md). It
> explains every step on Windows and Mac, including how to create the settings
> file, with no prior experience needed.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then configure a provider
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. See [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) for
Docker and password protection, and [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for
providers and environment variables.

### Models and what they're used for

Only a chat model is required; each of the others switches features on. Azure
settings are shown here; other providers use the `AI_*` equivalents. The
[full table](docs/configuration.md#models-and-what-theyre-used-for) covers
defaults and what happens without each one.

| Model | Setting | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Chat (required) | `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` or `AI_MODEL` | Chat, search Ask, notes and transformations, and the written Studio formats |
| Studio script | `AI_STUDIO_MODEL` (optional, defaults to chat) | Audio-overview scripts, whiteboard and motion scene plans, training transcripts |
| Embeddings | `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT` or `AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Semantic retrieval and search; keyword ranking without it |
| Image | `AZURE_OPENAI_IMAGE_DEPLOYMENT` or `AI_IMAGE_MODEL` | AI-image infographics, whiteboard videos and motion explainers |
| Vision | `AZURE_OPENAI_VISION_DEPLOYMENT` or `AI_VISION_MODEL` | Reading uploaded images and the screen helper (defaults to chat) |
| Transcription | `AZURE_OPENAI_TRANSCRIPTION_DEPLOYMENT` or `AI_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL` | Audio and video sources |
| Realtime voice | `AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_DEPLOYMENT` or `AI_REALTIME_MODEL` | Live discussions |
| Azure Speech | `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION` + `AZURE_SPEECH_RESOURCE_ID` (or `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY`) | Every voice: audio overviews, video narration, training-video avatars |
| Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | YouTube transcripts |

Whiteboard videos and motion explainers also need Python 3 with `numpy`,
`Pillow` and `imageio-ffmpeg`.
